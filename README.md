# work-day-scheduler

## Proposal/Requirements
*   GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
*   WHEN I open the planner
*   THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
*   WHEN I scroll down
*   THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
*   WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
*   THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
*   WHEN I click into a timeblock
*   THEN I can enter an event
*   WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
*   THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
*   WHEN I refresh the page
*   THEN the saved events persist
